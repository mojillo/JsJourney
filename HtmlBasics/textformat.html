        During the Great Famine in Ireland one of the biggest problems was that there was an extreme right wing 'free
        markets'
        type called Charles Trevelyan who was put in charge of the UK government response to the famine(a famine that they
        themselves created through the exploitation of Ireland, they were actually still exporting crops FROM ireland while
        people starved to death).Specifically he viewed the manufactured famine as an "effective mechanism for reducing
        surplus
        population".</p>
    
        <p>He's rightly regarded as a monster, someone who viewed the poor and exploited as somehow morally lesser and
        deserving of their deaths.</p>
    
        <p>Well his great granddaughter Laura was assigned to Northern Ireland to report for the BBC in the 90s and was shocked
        to learn that her family name was reviled on the island. So she did what any upper class English woman would do. She
        went back to England and wrote a book about how the silly Irish had misunderstood her great grandpapa and how he was
        a lovely family man.</p>
